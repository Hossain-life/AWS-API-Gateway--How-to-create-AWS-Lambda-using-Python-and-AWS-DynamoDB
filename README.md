# AWS-API-Gateway--How-to-create-AWS-Lambda-using-Python-and-AWS-DynamoDB
In this project, I created a donation parsing block for universal basic food provider. To implement this parsing block, initially, I created a donor table in aws dynamodb so that a donor can add his preferences in the data model. After that, I created a lambda function in aws lambda services, and I wrote the code for lambda function in python file so that api gateway can provision back end services using HTTP requests to dynamodb. I used the package boto3 in my code. Subsequently, I created a rest api in api gateway and then chose my lambda function from gateway. I also chose resources to select methods. For my case, I chose post method in api. Once I clicked that, I wrote code in json for passing the donor preferances in the databases, and to my sheer amazement, it worked. I was able to see new entries in dynamodb table.
